  pc: `This is my PC. I work mostly in Python/Java these days.
    I also like Javascript and C# and just started making my own game in Unity using C#. Anyway regardless of the language, I just like programming and solving problems.
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/JohnnyHackz" target="_blank">Github</a>!`,

  "cs-degree": `This is my CS degree. I hung it on the wall because I'm proud of it. It taught me many things but none as important as how to commit and finish something. There was many times I wanted to quit but I didn't. It was a very theoretical degree but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,

  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch TV and spend quality time with my family. I will also scroll through LinkedIn looking to connect with other Devs and Cyber Professionals.
   Here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakobberentsen/" target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a>, add me and lets chat!`,

  projects: `Info about this portfolio: It's made with the Kaboom.js library which is a library for making games in JavaScript.
    Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas.`,

  library: `There are a lot of programming and cyber books on my shelves.
    I love to read but often times I never completely finish them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
